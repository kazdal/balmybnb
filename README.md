The homepage is features a search bar that is built using Google Places Autocomplete. The search bar component also utilizes Google's Geocoding API to turn location into coordinates. This page also features handpicked locations that are currently recommended.

#### Search

After utilizing the search bar on the home page users are brought to the search results page. Right after the search bar is used the Google Map is centered to the searched location. The backend is then queried for only spots within the current map bounds. Any user movement of the map will query the backend based on the updated map bounds.

On this page users can browse their search results and can filter according to price.

#### Spot Show

This page allows users to view a specific spot's images, create a booking and leave a review. The booking calendar utilizes AirBnB engineering's own calendar library, React-Dates. Dates that are booked are greyed out and unselectable.
